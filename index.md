I am a freelance iOS developer, technical consultant, and open-source contributor. I have a wealth of experience working with clients from around the world. I offer my services as an iOS developer for hire to work with businesses of all sizes including start-ups, creative agencies, designers, individuals and other freelancers & developers.

The work I provide is of the highest quality, fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to ensure each project is well-architected, well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance an app as your company grows.
